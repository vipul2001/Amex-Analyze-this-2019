# Softmax Function 
The softmax function is also a type of sigmoid function but is handy when we are trying to handle classification problems.

Nature :- non-linear
Uses :- Usually used when trying to handle multiple classes. The softmax function would squeeze the outputs for each class between 0 and 1 and would also divide by the sum of the outputs.
Ouput:- The softmax function is ideally used in the output layer of the classifier where we are actually trying to attain the probabilities to define the class of each input.
# Results
Trying for L=[5,6,7].
The correct answer is
[0.09003057317038046, 0.24472847105479764, 0.6652409557748219]
And your code returned
[0.09003057317038046, 0.24472847105479764, 0.6652409557748219]

Correct!
